        <h3>Property Rental System</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;This is a desktop application developed as part of a semester long project while taking the ENSF 480 - Principles of Software Engineering
            at the Univiersity of Calgary. The problem this project was trying to solve was to manage a hypothetical database for a property rental system
            where landlords may register and list properties available for rental, where renters are then able to view the details and send emails to the
            landlord (Since this is for a hypothetical database, it doesn't actually send an email, but it shows the process a renter would take).
            <br><br>
            In order to run the JAR file, you need to have the latest version of JRE and MySQL installed. In MySQL, you must also have a connection where
            the hostname is "localhost", the port is "3306", the account username is "root", and the password is "ryanRoot2001". You should also ensure that
            you have imported the database using the MySQL Workbench.
