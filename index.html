        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 20-year-old third-year engineering software student studying at the University of Calgary. I have worked on various major projects as part
            of the curriculum of my courses as well as a few personal projects. My interests are rather broad; I'm fine with working on anything so long as I'm
            writing or designing code, but I have a particular preference towards working on AI and its applications. In fact, one of the biggest reasons for me pursuing
            software engineering as a career is explore the application of AI in everyday life, whether it's as simple as simulating the behaviour for video game 
            characters to recognizing natural language to adapting to real-world sistuations. Besides AI, the other reason for my pursuing of software engineering
            is how versatile and useful it can be in almost every industry. In our increasingly technological society, we are collecting and recieving more information
            in all sectors, and a software engineer is one of the careers perfect for managing and manipulating that information to best suit our needs.

            When I am not working on software projects, personal or otherwise, I like to spend my time playing video games, watching YouTube, cooking, and working out.

        <h3>Property Rental System</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;This is a desktop application developed as part of a semester long project while taking the ENSF 480 - Principles of Software Engineering
            at the Univiersity of Calgary. The problem this project was trying to solve was to manage a hypothetical database for a property rental system
            where landlords may register and list properties available for rental, where renters are then able to view the details and send emails to the
            landlord (Since this is for a hypothetical database, it doesn't actually send an email, but it shows the process a renter would take).
            <br><br>
            In order to run the JAR file, you need to have the latest version of JRE and MySQL installed. In MySQL, you must also have a connection where
            the hostname is "localhost", the port is "3306", the account username is "root", and the password is "ryanRoot2001". You should also ensure that
            you have imported the database using the MySQL Workbench.
